The WriteLine() method is often used to display variable values to the console window.

To combine both text and a variable, use the + character:

Example
string name = "John";
Console.WriteLine("Hello " + name);

You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:

Example
string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = "Doe";
string fullName = firstName + lastName;
Console.WriteLine(fullName);

For numeric values, the + character works as a mathematical operator (notice that we use int (integer) variables here):

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
Console.WriteLine(x + y); // Print the value of x + y

From the example above, you can expect:

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
Then we use the WriteLine() method to display the value of x + y, which is 11
