Logical Operators
As with comparison operators, you can also test for True or False values with logical operators.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	     Name	                                       Description	
&& 	Logical and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
