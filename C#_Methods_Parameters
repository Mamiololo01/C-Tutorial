Parameters and Arguments
Information can be passed to methods as parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method.

They are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a method that takes a string called fname as parameter. When the method is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the method to print the full name:

Example
static void MyMethod(string fname) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(fname + " Refsnes");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  MyMethod("Liam");
  MyMethod("Jenny");
  MyMethod("Anja");
}

// Liam Refsnes
// Jenny Refsnes
// Anja Refsnes
 
 
 
 
 

When a parameter is passed to the method, it is called an argument. So, from the example above: fname is a parameter, while Liam, Jenny and Anja are arguments.

Multiple Parameters
You can have as many parameters as you like, just separate them with commas:

Example
static void MyMethod(string fname, int age) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(fname + " is " + age);
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  MyMethod("Liam", 5);
  MyMethod("Jenny", 8);
  MyMethod("Anja", 31);
}

// Liam is 5
// Jenny is 8
// Anja is 31
