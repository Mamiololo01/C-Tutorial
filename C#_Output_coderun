C# Output
To output values or print text in C#, you can use the WriteLine() method:

Example
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:
Console.WriteLine(10 + 23);

The Write Method
There is also a Write() method, which is similar to WriteLine().

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

Console.Write("Hello World! ");
Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");
